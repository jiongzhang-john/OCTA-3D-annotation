# Artifact-suppressed 3D Retinal Microvascular Segmentation via Multi-scale Topology Regulation
This work is currently under review. 

This repository contains two OCTA datasets used in our study. The Zeiss dataset includes 34 OCTA volumes with a spatial resolution of 3 mm Ã— 3 mm Ã— 2 mm and a voxel size of 245 Ã— 245 Ã— 1024, of which 6 volumes are from healthy subjects and 28 volumes are from patients diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy (DR). The Optovue dataset consists of 25 OCTA volumes with the same spatial resolution but a voxel size of 304 Ã— 304 Ã— 640. All volumes in this dataset are from healthy subjects and were randomly selected and manually annotated from the publicly available OCTA-500 dataset [15]. T
